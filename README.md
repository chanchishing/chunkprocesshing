Dataquest study project [Practice Optimizing Dataframes and Processing in Chunks]

Dataquest Guided Project: Optimizing Dataframes and Processing in Chunks
We'll be working with financial lending data from Lending Club, a marketplace for personal loans that matches borrowers with investors.
In this project, it is assumed that that we only have 10 megabytes of memory available throughout this project, so you can practice the concepts of process large CSV as chunk and reduce memeory usage of chunks by analysis the data in chunk and set data types of columns accordingly.
